## Stock Valuation Simplified

### What is unique about this web app?

Provides a simple interface where a custom list of stocks can be compared on forward p/e and ebitda valuation metrics.

It also provides, in the same page, the historical and projected financials for the relevant valuation metrics.

I haven't found another site that has this functionality.

### Architecture

Front-end:  React / Next.js
Back-end: Django Rest Framework, PostgreSQL

### How to run locally?

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

ThenOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
